# üîê Cyber Security Ciphers in React

Welcome to the **Cyber Security Ciphers** project! This React and TypeScript-based project showcases implementations of various classical ciphers, bringing the fascinating world of cryptography to life. Whether you're a student, professional, or just curious, these components will help you understand and visualize how different encryption techniques work right in your browser.

## üöÄ Getting Started

- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IAmParthivsinh-15/Ciphering_Algorithms.git
   cd nextjs
Install Dependencies:

Next, install all the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Start the Development Server:

Now, you're ready to start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Your application will be up and running at http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser to start exploring the ciphers!

üîë Cipher Implementations
Explore a variety of classical ciphers, each implemented as a React component in the pages directory. Here's a quick overview:

Affine Cipher (affine.tsx): A monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.
Columnar Transposition Cipher (columnar.tsx): Rearranges plaintext into a grid and reads it off in columns for secure messages.
Feistel Cipher (feistel.tsx): A basic Feistel structure, a building block for many modern encryption algorithms.
Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher (mono.tsx, monoalphabetic.tsx): A substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced with a fixed letter of the alphabet.
Playfair Cipher (playfair.tsx): A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.
Rail Fence Cipher (railfence.tsx): A simple transposition cipher that jumbles the order of letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern.
Shift Cipher (shift.tsx): The classic Caesar cipher, which shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number.
Vigen√®re Cipher (vigener.tsx): A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword to make encryption harder to crack than simple substitution.
üé® Visualization & Interaction
Each cipher comes with interactive components that allow you to:

Encrypt and Decrypt: See the process in action by entering your text and key.
Visualize the Process: Understand how each step transforms the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
Experiment with Variations: Modify keys and inputs to see how changes affect the output.
C++ Cipher Implementations
In addition to the React implementations, this project also includes C++ implementations of various ciphers. Here are the available files:

DES (des.cpp): Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.
Affine & Feistel Ciphers (affine_feistel.cpp): Combined implementation of the Affine cipher and the Feistel structure.
Rail Fence & Columnar Transposition Ciphers (railfence_columnar.cpp): Implementation of both the Rail Fence and Columnar Transposition ciphers.
RSA (rsa.cpp): Implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm.
Shift, Monoalphabetic, Vigen√®re, and Playfair Ciphers (shift_monoalphabetic_vigenere_playfair.cpp): Combined implementation of the Shift cipher, Monoalphabetic cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and Playfair cipher.
